# GEOSCC

GEOSCC is a lightweight tool for building Shewhart control charts, also known as x and R charts, using development parameters such as yearly oil discharge Qo, yearly water discharge Qw, and number of wells N. 

Prevention of probable deviation from optimal configuration and statistical control of the observed process 
require the analysis of the most regulated parameters, such as the annual water discharge, the number of active wells and discharge per single well. 

Shewhart method makes it possible to identify a cause in dynamic systems disturbance, and can therefore be used for their timely prevention and optimal regulation of development process.
